## Pettswood

[Pettswood] runs executable documentation: human-readable specs written by users, that run against your code as tests. The [Pettswood Ecosystem] contains examples of tests and test fixture, a library of test fixture so that developers can contribute their own real-world experience, and tools to make the editing and maintenance of executable documentation easier.
